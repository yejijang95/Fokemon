This is my very wack knock-off Pokemon Game - Fokemon!!! :)
with veryyyyy limited functionality
Atm - only the map works!

I used Phaser & Tiled to create this.

I used this article - https://medium.com/@michaelwesthadley/modular-game-worlds-in-phaser-3-tilemaps-1-958fc7e6bbd6

I used this repo for the assets - https://github.com/Tuxemon/Tuxemon
